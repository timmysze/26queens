- a read-only masterTable with the blocks that are available
- client error checking for firebase...
  - if error, then check the masterTable again

blocks:
- should have jobs that take like a minute
- client can have intermediate job progress
- clients can fix each other.. if one messes things up, then the next might fix it

triggering admin check:
- when clients think that a block is done, add a note somewhere for admin to do cleanup
- admin pulls out this table and persists it as a log of client work

block checking:
- read the solutions block
- remove from the masterTable
- random checks?
- 2x redundancy/validation?

if completed properly:
- off board that block
- off board those solutions
- on board a new block


if not actually completed properly:
- probably just put the whole block back?
